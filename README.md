**THE SOFTWARE IS STILL UNDER PROGRESS
**

**RICS Analysis GUI**
A modular, extensible graphical user interface for performing and analyzing Raster Image Correlation Spectroscopy (RICS) experiments. This toolkit supports simulation, data import/export, and advanced analysis with a user-friendly workflow designed for membrane biophysics, imaging, and fluorescence correlation studies.

**Features**
Flexible RICS simulations: Isotropic, anisotropic, and rotated diffusion models.

Analysis: Fit and analyze real or simulated image stacks. (Non-GUI batch analysis)

Progress monitoring: Responsive GUI with real-time progress and status bars.

Modular design: Easily extend with new simulation, import, or analysis modules.

Visualization: Integrated with Matplotlib for RICS map display and fitting results.
